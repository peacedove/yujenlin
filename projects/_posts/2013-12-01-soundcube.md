<p class="detail">
    This paper presents the prototype using Kinect to track userâ€™s movement in the space, to interact with invisible virtual objects with audio feedback in physical environment. In this project, the user manipulates the virtual sound object in both ego- and allocentric spatial reference. The concept is to let the user uses body movement to produces sound in real-time, so a mime actor or a dancer can have improvised movement with correspondent sound effect
