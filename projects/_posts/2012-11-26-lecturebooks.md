<p class="detail">My team is now analyzing and evaluating the LectureBooks site, which is is an alternative to traditional textbooks. It contains all the contents of your textbook plus the ability to performs self-help quizzes, search the text, write in margins and ask questions of clarification. We will conduct several interviews and analyze the site based on some usability evaluation methods, such as interaction maps, persona and scenario.</p>
