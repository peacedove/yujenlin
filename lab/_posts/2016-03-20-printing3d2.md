<h2 class="title">Rhino: 3D Modeling</h2>
<p>The character I'm modeling is a Japanese anime character called Keroro, which is a alien frog. The software I am using this time is Rhino. Since Rhino is good at modeling curvature surface, I think this character might be good to model using Rhino. The Technique I use a lot when modeling Keroro is FlowAlongSrf, which I followed the video tutorial below. I later remake the helmet.</p>

<h2 class="title">Rhino: Joint Design</h2>
<p>My model should be able to wear different hats; therefore, the hat and the head are two different parts. Since the arms can only rotate along the horizontal axis, so making the joint as a cylinder is fine. I would like to make the head rotate freely along x-, y-, and z-axes, so I borrow the design for Gunpla. However, in their design, one of the connectors is made of rubber, which is flexible. The 3D printed material is not as flexible as that, plus I make the hole too shallow, which makes the joint doesn't work as I expected.</p>

<h2 class="title">Magics: 3D model repairs and hollowing</h2>
<p>Magics is a software good at fixing 3D model. Before using this software, we need to export our model as STL from Rhino. Each part should be a separate STL file. We fix some error in this software to prevent some unexpected problem when printing. The software is also good for hollowing and perforating the model. However, it is important to resize your model to the scale you want before hollowing the model; otherwise, the wall might be too thin and it would break easily during the printing process.</p>

<h2 class="title">PreForm: Ready to print</h2>
<p>When everything is ready, we can use the PreForm software to check everything is correct, layout the parts and generate supports.</p>

<h2 class="title">Printed: 3D printing model and repairing</h2>
<p>I made my first model's wall too thin, so it breaks. I adjust the thickness of the wall and print it again, but there is still a small whole on the body. Fortunately, it is easy to fill the whole. First, I used a toothpick to put some resin over the whole, and use the UV laser pointer to solidify the resin. The parts are able to be glued together using super glue. The glue will melt down the material a little bit and stick the part together; however, it is a lot slower and messier compare with using resin and UV laser to glue parts</p>

<h2 class="title">Painting</h2>
<p>The paint I'm using is Citadel. I start the painting with the lightest color first and go with the darkest color later. The paint can be easily mixed to adjust the color, so the helmet is actually mixing the green paint that I apply to the body and the yellow color they I use to paint the star. After the painting, the paint requires some time before it is fully dried. I didn't notice that and put the helmet on before the paint is fully dried and now the two parts are sticking together.</p>
