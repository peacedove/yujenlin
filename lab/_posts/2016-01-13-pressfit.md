<p>The assignment is to design a press-fit construction kit that could be put together in multiple ways. I tried to limit myself to design every piece look exactly the same, and inspired by following pictures when I search online.</p>

<p>I therefore decided to make all of my pieces equilateral triangles except the connector. I first tried cutting some foam board in SI's <a href="http://doiiit.github.io">DOIIIT studio</a>. The foam board is really soft, and it is hard to get a nice cut by using scissors or utility knife. Although the cut is not clean, it still prove that my design might work</p>

<p>I then tried my first 3D laser cutting. The shape looks nice, and the cutting is clear and clean, but the tooth I design is too big, and the bar connector does not look nice. Tomorrow, I will try to make some measurement tools first to look what is the suitable width for the tooth based on the foamcore board we are using</p>
